# Introduction

This project presents an analytical Spotify Dashboard, focused on exploring music trends, audience engagement, and the characteristics of the most popular songs. The main objective was not only to visualize data but also to test and implement advanced functionalities in Power BI, such as integration with external APIs and the use of custom visuals (`Deneb` and `HTML Content`). The dashboard aims to empower music enthusiasts, industry professionals, or data analysts to understand the success of songs, artists, and genres, as well as analyze release patterns and sonic attributes that drive consumption.

## Project Structure

The dashboard is designed to offer a multifaceted view of the Spotify music universe, covering:

*   **Audience Metrics**: Average listeners per year and total streams.
*   **Song and Artist Ranking**: Identification of songs with the most streams and the total number of artists in the dataset.
*   **Sound Characteristics**: Analysis of attributes such as Acoustics, Danceability, Liveness, Speechiness, Valence, and the Energy percentage of the music.
*   **Release Patterns**: Distribution of releases over the years and by month.
*   **Specific Song Details**: Information such as the release date of hits and total streams.

## Technologies Used

For the construction of this analytical and technically advanced dashboard, the tools employed were:

*   **Power BI**: For data modeling, creation of DAX measures, and construction of interactive visuals. It served as the central platform to orchestrate all analyses.
*   **Figma**: The prototyping and design of the dashboard were done with Figma, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
*   **Python**: Used to enrich the dataset by accessing the Spotify API to obtain album cover URLs.
*   **Spotify API**: Accessed via Python to collect additional information (album cover URLs) that was not available in the original dataset.
*   **HTML Visuals (HTML Content)**: A custom Power BI visual used to render album covers directly in the dashboard, from the URLs obtained via API.
*   **DENEB (Custom Visual)**: An advanced Power BI visual that allows creating custom charts using Vega and Vega-Lite specifications. It was used for visualizing the music's "Energy%" percentage, offering granular control over graphic design.
*   **Adobe Color Palette**: Used to define the dashboard's color theme, visually aligning it with Spotify's brand identity.

## ETL Process (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading)

The ETL process for the Spotify Dashboard was particularly interesting due to the data enrichment step:

1.  **Extraction**: The main dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, from "Top Spotify Songs 2023" (`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023?resource=download`).
2.  **Enrichment (Python & API)**: Before importing into Power BI, the dataset was augmented using a Python script. This script accessed the Spotify API to collect the image URLs of each album cover, adding them as a new column to the dataset. This step was fundamental for the visual aspect of the dashboard.
3.  **Transformation**: In Power Query, an integral part of Power BI, the necessary transformation was performed to consolidate date information. The dataset had separate columns for release date, release month, and release year. A new calculated column was created that combined these three pieces of information into a single date format, facilitating time intelligence analyses and navigation.
4.  **Modeling and DAX Measures**: Within Power BI, data modeling was performed to structure the dataset, and DAX measures were created to calculate metrics such as the average listeners per year, streams per song, and other analyses that comprise the dashboard.
5.  **Loading**: After all extraction, enrichment, and transformation steps, the data was loaded into the Power BI data model, ready to feed all the visuals of the dashboard.

# Dashboard

The dashboard features a modern design aligned with Spotify's visual identity, conceived in Figma and refined in Power BI. The visuals are clear and objective, combining KPI cards, bar charts for rankings, a custom `Deneb` visual for music "Energy%", and the innovative highlight of album covers rendered via `HTML Content`. Interactivity is a central feature, allowing users to explore songs by artist, year, or specific characteristics, providing an immersive experience in music data analysis.

## Insights

The analysis of the data presented in the Spotify Dashboard revealed important insights into music trends and consumption:

*   **Audience Engagement**:
    *   The **Average Listeners per Year is 514.14 Million**, an impressive number that reflects the platform's vast user base and the massive consumption of music.
    *   The dashboard highlights that the total streams for songs can reach **4 Billion**, demonstrating the reach and popularity of the most played tracks.

*   **Top Songs by Streams**:
    *   The panel identifies the most successful songs in terms of streams, such as "Blinding Lights", "Shape of You", "Someone You Loved", "Dance Monkey", "Sunflower - Spider-...", "One Dance", "STAY (with Justin Bieber)", "Believer", and "Closer". These are the tracks that dominate the charts and capture the attention of billions of listeners.
    *   The "Songs by Streams" visualization indicates the distribution of streams among tracks, ranging from 0 Billion to 4 Billion, demonstrating the power of major hits.

*   **Artist Diversity**:
    *   The dataset covers a total of **38 Artists**, indicating the variety of talents represented in the most popular songs.

*   **Sound Characteristics of Songs**:
    *   The dashboard explores dimensions such as **Acoustics, Danceability, Liveness, Speechiness**, and **Valence**, providing an understanding of the attributes that make songs popular.
    *   A technical highlight is the visualization of "Energy%" (64%), which indicates the perceived level of energy and intensity in the music. This visual, built with `Deneb`, offers a creative and effective way to represent a specific metric.

*   **Release Patterns Over Time**:
    *   The "Releases by Year" analysis shows the distribution of songs released from 1940 to 2020, with a significant peak of releases in more recent years, reaching 500 releases per year in the most active period.
    *   The "Songs by Month" visualization details the distribution of releases or most played songs by month (January, June, May, October, November, December, April, March, July, August), allowing for identification of seasonality in the music industry.

## Considerations

The Spotify dashboard not only provides valuable insights into music consumption but also serves as a testament to the advanced capabilities of Power BI and the integration of various tools. From the insights and the development process, some important considerations emerge:

*   **Technical Challenge Overcome**: The integration with the Spotify API via Python for the script demonstrates an ability to connect and enrich data from external sources in an automated and intelligent way.
*   **Advanced Visualization**: The implementation of HTML visuals for album covers and the use of Deneb for music "Energy%" elevate the level of professionalism and immersion of the dashboard, highlighting the ability to go beyond Power BI's standard visuals.

## Conclusion

This project represents a fusion of data analysis, programming, and design, enabling the understanding of the digital music landscape and solidifying skills in creating BI solutions.
